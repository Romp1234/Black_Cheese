<h2>Black Cheese</h2>
<p>
<h4>You must be wondering what black cheese is. Isn't it just a type of Cheese ? Apparently that wasn't always the case. In the late 70's and 80's, Ray ban; the popular shades maker used to market their shades as 'Black Cheese'. </p>

<b>Bizzare</b> isn't it ?

Apparently the then sales head of the Company, Mr. John Stanislaks thought it would be a fitting name to their budding products as Cheese was the 'IT' thing. According to him, people at that time were in love with cheese. "They had cheese on everything, with everything, we actually had to import cheese from Mexico at that time". Another reason for the name was the fact that people actually thought the Moon was made of <u>Cheese</u>.<br>
